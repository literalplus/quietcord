# üí§ QuietCord [![Build Status](https://ci.l1t.li/job/public~quietcord/badge/icon)](https://ci.l1t.li/job/public~quietcord)
A simple BungeeCord plugin which aims to reduce log spam caused by InitialHandler.

# üìñ User Story
Don't you know this problem?

You want to find some useful information in your BungeeCord log and are too lazy to
set up a custom log for your plugin?

You open an issue with BungeeCord, but [nothing happens](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord/pull/1484)??

You end up endlessly scrolling through your logs because `grep` is too difficult for you
and your clueless server owner doesn't allow you to Install Gentoo‚Ñ¢?

Are you sick of your [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) logs looking like this?
